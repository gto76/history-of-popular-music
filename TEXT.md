Did Lamar just kill Hip Hop?
============================


[DAMN.](images/damn.jpg)


Ok, hold your horses. Just let me explain the theory and then judge.

So according to the theory every major music ganra has roughly 30 years until it's done. Done in a sense that after that nothing can change our (perception of what a ganra is and what it should sound like.) expectations of what a ganra should sound like. [*People are of course still using elements from dead ganras and incorporate them in music, but that propagates their ganra, but has no effect on our definition and perception of the dead ganra > Or they are just in post era.]


[graph](images/graph.png)

As seen on the graph every ganra starts with a proto era (green area), in which it is slowly and gradualy developing. Then comes the breaktrough single, which (starts the craze/puts it in a spotlite) puts it on a map and draws the attention of listeners, artists and music buisnies alike. This is the start of the ganra's golden age which lasts roughly 10 years, and also a moment in which the clock starts ticking. Then follows 10 years of crisis in which two other ganras steel the focus. In second half of the crisis era, there emerges one subganra, that brings out the worst of the ganra, examples of which are glam rock, hair metal, skate punk, bling rap and bro step. Crisis ends with a revival of ganra that usualy consists of many new and diverse subganras. And now comes my contraversial claim, that the death of a ganra happens between two albums made by an exceptional artist. One a masterpiece, that the artist is never again able to surpass, although he produces many more great albums, and the other the album after that. The masterpiece album rises expectations and apetites of many and the future of the ganra seems bright, while actualy it stands on it's last legs (it's on it's last breath).

Another thing that might be contraversial in this theory besides the selection of the chosen ones are the ganras they are associated with. But anyways, lets list them, namely Tom Waits for R&R, Beck for Rock, LCD Soundsystem for Punk and Lamar for Hip-hop. Lamar is probably the least contraversial choice among them, simply because he's a rapper, but still if we look at the music on the Pimp a Butterfly, it's a mix of many diverse ganras and sounds, everything from funk to jazz and that's something that is common to all the chosen legendary albums. Specificly Tom Waits' Big time, a collection of live recordings of songs from his last three albums, could be described as anything from blues, gospel, balads, blues rock and cabare... Becks' Odelay could be described as a mixture of old-school hip-hop, delta blues, country, grunge and noise. LCD soundistems Sound of Silver contains mixture of electronica, funk, new wave, post-punk and bowie sound.


So maybe let's first focus on less contraversial choices — the selection of breaketrough singles. Or maybe better let's explain why only this ganras and why they are divided as they are.

Maybe the most glarring are the ommisions of Pop and Jazz, but also if you look closely the EDM (electronic dance music) does not start before 90. That is because I excluded the EDM, that is made for dancefloor and only left the part that can be listened sitting down. Pop is, as it was mentioned many times before, the ultimate absorber and survivor and it will exist forever. Jazz is a ganra that really comes to life in live setting and trough imporvisation, and something always gets lost when it's captured on a record.

Another curiosity is quantitiy of ganras crammed in rock and roll before it's breaktrough single "Rock around the clock" that started the rock and roll craze in 56. Reason for that is that the progres from boogie woggie to fully developed rock and roll was exceptionally gradual. This evolution basically consists of addition of new instruments and vocals to the rithm that stayed preety much the same from the beggining. (Troought this evolution the rithm basicaly remain  The rythm was basically the same from the beggining, and what was) Of course there were the subganras, that had their own rhytms, and are not meant to be included in proto rnr, such as western music (bluegrass?).

Main reasons for the big break that happened in 56 is the merging of black and country markets (and also singles/albums). Before that almost no white people were buying black music and vice versa. This, together with a shorter time that was needed from recording session to release of a single, contributed to more flouid progression of a style, that became known as rock and roll.

So as with rock and roll, every major ganra that preceeded (sucedded?) it started with a hit single, that basicaly defined it, and so it happens that this singles were following eachchoder in intervals of roughly 10 years. The other singles being "Satisfaction" by Roling stones for rock, "Blietzkrieg Bop" by Ramones for punk, "Walk this way" by RUN DMC (in colaboration with Aerosmith) for Hiphop and "Groove is in the hearth" by "?" for EDM (electronic dance music).

For rock other candidates could be earlier single "?" by Kinks if one woluld want to include the whole brithis garage rock scene under rock or maybe some later single that was not anymore in style of garage rock like "?" by Doors. The significance of Blietzkrieg Bop and the whole Ramones debu album in general for punk can hardly be disputed, only thing one could hold against it, is that it wasn't really a hit single, and one could argue that the "Anarchy in the uk" or "God save the queen" from later that year are a better fit for a breaktrough single. As for hip-hop i think walk this way is a good fit, although it could be argued, that it was still a old-shool style hip-hop, and some other artists from next two years, like Ice-T or Public Enemy better signify the hip-hops step into golden age. Nontheles, none of them had such a big hit as RUN DMC had.
For EDM, if we define it as an electronic dance music that can be listened to sitting down, the commercial succes of Prodigys' "Fat Of The land" must be the big breaktrough moment.


Now I should probably address the oddity of eceptionally long era of proto hip hop. I must admit that it wasn't in my model from beggining in which the proto phase of hophop started with "Rapers delight" by Shugarhill gang. In this early version funk, disco and reaggeaa were placed in revival phase of rnb. Problem with this aproach is that rnb was preety much always just an umbrella term for black music styles, that didn't exist before 45. Also original rnb that was being played from 45 to 55 was together with rockabilly basicaly what became know as rock and roll after its breaktrough in 55 and it has sylisticly little in common with later "rnb", such as funk, reagge and disco. Another solution could also be to create a separate timeline for each one of these styles, but none of them had enough longjevety and prominence to justify that also, and that's basically the reason that they got packaded inside the proto hip-hop era. (so they got packaged inside the proto hip-hop, basicaly because it seems like the most elegant solution.)


So how come this eras coincide so neatly, (one might ask). It defenatly seams too good to be true, maybe even bordering on conspiracy theory. (Whathever the reasoning, it must include the economic/industry...) I must admit I didn't bother with it too much, but it must have to do something with the music industry / economic side of music. One thory could be based on the fact that the biggest force in salses of the albums were at least from the mid 40' onward the teenagers, which are at around the age of 14/15 most subseptable to the new music trends. And this new trends/crazes, must by definition sound and feel fresh and hip, they must be something your parents dislike and just don't get. So by this logic, if a ganra is at the point resurgence, this 15 year old teenager was 5 when it came into crisis, so just young enough to not yet be subsective enoght to the popular music...


So only inconsistency on the timeline left is a lack of emergance of new major ganra around year 2006. There are two possible explanations. First one is that we can adequatly clasify popular music only in retrospective, and so are lacking the prespective, that will alow us to fully understand what is currently happening in music. But this explanation just feals insuficient if we take in consideration what a huge stirs rock and roll and rock created in their first years, how distinctive punk was from the rock of its era, and the hard separation of Hiphop from other ganras by simple fact that the lyrics are being raped. In this case probably the more pessimistic option is true, namely that there are no new major ganras because the music industry as we kenw it pretty much died, by the 2006, when it was time for next big thing. (...because the music industry was already in such a bad shape by the 2006, that it wasn't able to procreate and push out the next big thing).

--------------------

- EDM -> Sitting down (can mantain our focus)
- So let's start (at a less contraversial claim, and more easily verifaiable claim...) at the beggining and see how ganras are born.
  |-> Breaktrought singles

They propel ganra from a proto phase (in which it is slowly maturing/developing/brewing/fermenting) to a golden age.

The cork (is) gets open with a lowd pop, graping everyones atention and champagne gets sprinkled all around and everybody is gathered around, wants a glass. Continuing with this analogy, of course no one is intereted anymore in the same champagne once the bubles settle (in) it gets kind of worm and sticky, and everyone either leaves the party, switches back to what they were drinking before, or starts doing drugs. Folowing this analogy, the revival of a ganra could be the morning after, when you wake up and open the fridge, and see the fancy and re-refregerated leftovers from the party and realize that they are actualy better than what you usaly have in the fridge and you start to (pick the interesting ones) concume them in a strange combinations and throw the bad ones out.

TIMELINE [     ]

ALBUMS [] [] [] []
   > So what constitutes the death of a ganra?

* RNB/ROCKABILY: Not counterpart but rockabily played by bl. musicians, or maybe: The same music as rockabilly, but played by bl. musicians.

* Describe how this are high ganras, that incorporate many small ones (ska, dub, ...)

* Beck/Tom: Tipping point of where a ganra can be streached (so that definition still has some cind of coherency), and before the bubble bursts (the wave breaks), and we're left with broken fragments, up for grabs for everyone...

* Butterfly: Poetry...., Basicaly the whole abum gives you a feeling like you are watching some messed up sf/thriller/horror/comedy/psycho drama/fantasy by linch.

Beck: Ending relationship/depresion, scientology
LCD: Being budened by touring and thoughts of quiting and how to end it all, documentary/madison square garden (comercialism?)
Lamar: More burduned by relegion/family
Waits: What was he doing from 88 to 92?

So it's not like it's directly their fault, but more that they dishartened not only themselves, by creating the artworks that were bigger than themselves, but they (probably) dishartended also other artists, giving them something to aprite to, but with no clear direction forward (tipping point?)

Also it has to be mentioned that all this legendary works were a colaboration of many brilliand minds that enabled to bring out the best from the artists...

In Tom Waits case, firt there was his wife that was (probably) a major influence on him to abondon his old "crying in the beer" persona and started a more csmopolitan/gipsy and weird (sinister) character. (Also his ecouraging split [but also producers ability to let waits expereiment with different aproaches] with his former producer with whom he recorded his first ? albums probably helped) Of course here were then the extraordinary musicians well versed in experimentation...

As for Beck there was an unbeliaveble "click" with dust brothers, legendary duo of producers and sampling gurus, who are responsible for Beastie boys boutique, and whos intentionaly added crackling noises are probably their most recognizable contribution to hip hop. (signature sound)

As for LCD Soundsystem it is preety clear that he would have a great difficulty realising his ideas on Sound of silver... Ideas feel so organic/lively and jammy, that it feels it would be impossible to realize them to such "standing/solidity" withouth a band (with only season musicians).

And of course Lamars Butterly, what more could be said... The amount of exceptional musicains and producers that had to work their asses of to make a record so perfectly produced, but that on no moment sound overproduced...

* Champagne analogy, three parts:
		singles [][][]
	A. Opening
		timeline [   ]
	B. Staleness: It just stands there, noone is ready to take it into the kitchen, yet almost noone wants to drink it anymore
		albums [][][]
	C. Morning after
	D. Baloon bursting ?
		next albums [][][] ?

Morning after:
We can actually enjoy the chapagne with clearer view and enjoy it for its taste... and find the right combination of acompanianing snacks, from the array of leftovers, ..

Of course after that it / or when the next thing comes we look at the mess and see basicaly garbage, that needs to be taken out. What were left with is only knowledge of how different brands really taste, so we can buy them in a future for different settings and combinations.

Realisation that, that is something you almost never have at home, and it would probably make sense to give it another try. Of course this time in a way and with combination of foods, that really suits you, and not as on party, ones that were available to everyone at the moment.

* Waits > Ali niso komadi, kot naprimer 1.Lie to me iz brawlers bol al man skoraj enaki komadom iz bi time ere?









-----------------

Pizda, pred elvisom je vse ful fluid, blues, boogie, country, rockabilly, skor nemogoce lepo razdelit vse...
Mogoce lahk to pripisem dejstvu da so singlce dominirale, kar je omogocl velik hitrejso absorbcijo novih elementov iz sorodnih zanrov...

---

Pa segregirani radiji so mel dost zraven, tko da so bli skor vsi stili podvojeni (al pa potrojeni, ce upostevamo se big bande ki so tud absorbiral vse novosti)...
Elvisov singl alright mama (54) je bil ful pomemben, ker ga niso hotl country radiji vrtet ker je biu too black, crni pa ker je bil too country, pol je pa ful eksplodiru in pripomogu da se je ta segregacija nehala.

Anyways, u glavnem mislm da mam resitev, in sicer bom dal vso to "navlako" pod proto rnr in je stvar resena :)

---

Exactly, vsi so bol al mn vse spilal,
sam ta model je meu pac par country komadov vmes (pa klobuk, aja pa biu je beuc), da je lahko pol spilov po teh kantri tv showih, ko so bli takrat ful popularni.

---

Mislm ja, v osnovi je to boogie woogie, ki se mu je pocasi dodajal instrumente in vokale (na zacetku se je spilov samo na klavirju in bol al mn brez vokalov, izvira pa iz severnega teksasa) in na koncu se je temu rekl rock and roll, ampak ni pa nobenega ful revolucionarnega preloma v tem razvoju.

---

Razen komada rock around a clock, ki je zacel rock and roll craze (ker je bil v enmu filmu), ampak to bi biu lahko tud ker drug komad...

=====

Ma ja, doklr je zanr v proto fazi se ful organsko razvija, z majhnimi koraki, pol pa ko se enkrat prebije in pride v primez industrije/dobi label (zacne prnasat denar), se pa stvari dost spremenijo. 

=====

Sam to se ni mel tolk mocnega vpliva pred rockenrolom, ker si meu tri locene trge (crni, country pa bigband), tko da ko je ena industrija prjela en svoj zanr (naprimer crna bluz v 25 - 35) sta ga lahko ostale dve neobremenjeno absorbirali in evolvali na svoj nacin.

---

Me je zanimal še če so mel črnci tud svoje "record companies" (poleg štacun in radijov) in skor ja (sam da so belci na koncu pobral denar :)

Most of Paramount's race music recordings were arranged by black entrepreneur J. Mayo Williams. "Ink" Williams, as he was known, had no official position with Paramount, but he was given wide latitude to bring African-American talent to the Paramount recording studios and to market Paramount records to African-American consumers. Williams did not know at the time that the "race market" had become Paramount's prime business and that he was keeping the label afloat.

---

Dobr, sej na koncu je pa odpru svoj Sazas, ki je sam pobirov denar od pravic, ki jih je nabrou skozi leta, se bol fancy... 
Pa itak, ce se je le dal ni naprej artistiom posredvov njihov share... klasika :)

---

Pa tud dost ocitno je iz podatka, da je prtisku na artiste da naj "clean upajo svoj act", da je hotu s crno musko prodret tud na beli trg. To je mogu bit takrat ful holy grail, kao komu bo prvemu ratal (sanse za obratno, se prav da bi crnci zacel poslusat country, so ble verjetn manjse :).

Mislm da je biu prvi artist, ki mu je zares ratal Louis Jordan  (jump blues/rnb, rnr v bistvu) leta 46, z hiti ala Caldonia, ko so beli tinejdzeri ful zapalil... Naprimer v eni crni stacuni v crnem delu LA-ja, so takrat zabelezl da so 40% plat prodal belcem, kar je blo verjeten pred tem skor nula.

---

Iz te perspektive ma tud tist Hitler blues dost smisla, koncno so bli crnci in belci v istem dreku 》record blues song 》profit :)
