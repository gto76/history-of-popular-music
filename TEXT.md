Did Lamar just kill Hip Hop?
============================


[DAMN.](images/damn.jpg)


Ok, hold your horses. Just let me explain the theory and then judge.


Life Expectancy of a Genre
--------------------------
So according to my theory, every major popular music genre has roughly 30 years until it's done. Done in a sense that after that nothing can change our perception of what a genre is and what it should sound like [expectations of what a genre should sound like]. [*People are of course still using elements from dead genres and incorporate them in music, but that propagates their genre, but has no effect on our definition and perception of the dead genre > Or they are just in post era.]

Three Periods in Life of a Genre
--------------------------------
[As seen on the graph] Every genre starts with a proto era (green area), in which it is slowly and gradually developing. Then comes the breakthrough single, which (starts the craze/puts it in a spotlight) puts it on a map and draws the attention of listeners, artists and music business alike. This is the start of the genre's golden age which lasts roughly 10 years, and also a moment in which the clock starts ticking. Then follows 10 years of crisis in which two other genres steel the focus. In second half of the crisis era, there emerges one sub-genre, that brings out the worst of the genre, examples of which are glam rock, hair metal, skate punk, bling rap and brostep. Crisis ends with a revival of a genre that usually consists of many new and diverse sub-genres. And now comes my [controversial?] claim, that the death of a genre happens between two albums made by an exceptional artist. One a masterpiece, that the artist is never again able to surpass, although he produces many more great albums, and the other the album after that. The masterpiece album rises expectations and appetites of many and the future of the genre seems bright, while actually it stands on it's last legs (it's on it's last breath).

Chosen Prominent Artists
------------------------
Another thing that might be controversial in this theory besides the selection of the "chosen ones" are the genres they are associated with. But anyways, lets list them, namely Tom Waits for Rock and roll, Beck for Rock, LCD Soundsystem for Punk and Lamar for Hip-hop. Lamar is probably the least controversial choice among them, simply because he's a rapper, but still if we look at the music on the Pimp a Butterfly, it's a mix of many diverse genres and sounds, everything from funk to jazz and that's something that is common to all the chosen legendary albums. Specifically Tom Waits' Big time, a collection of live recordings of songs from his last three albums, could be described as anything from blues, gospel, ballads, blues rock and cabaret... Becks' Odelay could be described as a mixture of old-school hip-hop, delta blues, country, grunge and noise. LCD Soundsystems' Sound of Silver contains mixture of electronica, funk, new wave, post-punk and Bowie sound.


Selection of Genres
-------------------
So maybe let's first focus on less controversial choices — the selection of breakthrough singles. Or maybe better let's explain why only this genres and why they are divided as they are.

Maybe the most glaring are the omissions of Pop and Jazz, but also if you look closely the EDM (electronic dance music) does not start before 1990. That is because I excluded the EDM, that is made for dancefloor and only left the part that can be listened sitting down. Pop is, as it was mentioned many times before, the ultimate absorber and survivor and it will exist forever. Jazz is a genre that really comes to life in live setting and trough improvisation, and something always gets lost when it's captured on a record.


Proto Rock and Roll Sub-genres
------------------------------
Another curiosity is quantity of genres crammed in rock and roll before it's breakthrough single "Rock around the clock" that started the rock and roll craze in 56. Reason for that is that the progress from boogie-woogie to fully developed rock and roll was exceptionally gradual. This evolution basically consists of addition of new instruments and vocals to the rhythm that stayed pretty much the same from the beginning. (Throughout this evolution the rhythm basically remain  The rhythm was basically the same from the beginning, and what was) Of course there were the sub-genres, that had their own rhythms, and are not meant to be included in proto R'n'R, such as western music (bluegrass?).

Main reasons for the big break that happened in 56 is the merging of black and country markets (and also singles/albums). Before that almost no white people were buying black music and vice versa. This, together with a shorter time that was needed from recording session to release of a single, contributed to more fluid progression of a style, that became known as rock and roll.

[singles](images/singles.png)

Selection of Genre Defining Singles
-----------------------------------
So as with rock and roll, every major genre that preceded (succeeded?) it started with a hit single, that basically defined it, and so it happens that this singles were following each other in intervals of roughly 10 years. The other singles being "Satisfaction" by Rolling stones for rock, "Blietzkrieg Bop" by Ramones for punk, "Walk this way" by RUN DMC (in collaboration with Aerosmith) for Hip-hop and "Groove is in the hearth" by "?" for EDM (electronic dance music).

For rock other candidates could be earlier single "?" by Kinks if one would want to include the whole British garage rock scene under rock or maybe some later single that was not anymore in style of garage rock like "?" by Doors. The significance of Blitzkrieg Bop and the whole Ramones debut album in general for punk can hardly be disputed, only thing one could hold against it, is that it wasn't really a hit single, and one could argue that the "Anarchy in the UK" or "God save the queen" from later that year are a better fit for a breakthrough single. As for hip-hop i think walk this way is a good fit, although it could be argued, that it was still a old-school style hip-hop, and some other artists from next two years, like N.W.A. or Public Enemy better signify the hip-hops step into golden age. Nonetheless, none of them had such a big hit as RUN DMC had.
For EDM, if we define it as an electronic dance music that can be listened to sitting down, the commercial success of Prodigy's "Fat Of The land" must be the big breakthrough moment.


Proto Hip-hop Sub-genres
------------------------
Now I should probably address the oddity of exceptionally long era of proto hip hop. I must admit that it wasn't in my model from beginning in which the proto phase of hip-hop started with "Rapers delight" by Shugarhill gang. In this early version funk, disco and reggae were placed in revival phase of R'n'B. Problem with this approach is that R'n'B was pretty much always just an umbrella term for black music styles, that didn't exist before 1945. Also original R'n'B that was being played from 45 to 55 was together with rockabilly basically what became know as rock and roll after its breakthrough in 1955 and it has stylistically little in common with later "R'n'B", (such as funk, reggae and disco). Another solution could also be to create a separate timeline for each one of these styles, but none of them had enough longevity and prominence to justify that also, and that's basically the reason that they got packaged inside the proto hip-hop era. (so they got packaged inside the proto hip-hop, basically because it seems like the most elegant solution.)


Is it too Good to be True
-------------------------
So how come this eras coincide so neatly, (one might ask). It definitely seams too good to be true, maybe even bordering on conspiracy theory. (Whatever the reasoning, it must include the economic/industry...) I must admit I didn't bother with it too much, but it must have to do something with the music industry / economic side of music. One theory could be based on the fact that the biggest force in sales of the albums were at least from the mid 40' onward the teenagers, which are at around the age of 14/15 most susceptible to the new music trends. And this new trends/crazes, must by definition sound and feel fresh and hip, they must be something your parents dislike and just don't get. So by this logic, if a genre is at the point or resurgence, this 15 year old teenager was 5 when it came into crisis, so just young enough to not yet be susceptible to the popular music...


No New Genre in 2006
--------------------
So only inconsistency on the timeline left is a lack of emergence of new major genre around year 2006. There are two possible explanations. First one is that we can adequately classify popular music only in retrospective, and so are lacking the perspective, that will allow us to fully understand what is currently happening in music. But this explanation just feels insufficient if we take in consideration what a huge stirs rock and roll and rock created in their first years, how distinctive punk was from the rock of its era, and the hard separation of Hip-hop from other genres by simple fact that the lyrics are being raped. In this case probably the more pessimistic option is true, namely that there are no new major genres because the music industry as we knew it pretty much died, by the 2006, when it was time for next big thing. (...because the music industry was already in such a bad shape by the 2006, that it wasn't able to procreate and push out the next big thing).


Conclusion
----------
As for conclusion, I must say, that I find it hard to believe that hip hop has died in 2017. Maybe hip-hop as we know it died, but a new kind of hip-hop, musically much more daring and vibrant has just been born, and Lamar's single Be humble might just be the big break of this new kind of hip-hop, that was slowly fermenting during last 10 years.

Champagne Analogy, Three Parts
==============================
		LAMAR []
	A. Opening
		SINGLES [][][]
		TIMELINE [   ]
	B. Staleness
	C. Morning after
		ALBUMS [][][]
	D. Balloon bursting
		NEXT ALBUMS [][][]

The cork (is) gets open with a loud pop, graping everyones attention and champagne gets sprinkled all around and everybody is gathered around, wants a glass. Continuing with this analogy, of course no one is interested anymore in the same champagne once the bubbles settle (in) it gets kind of worm and sticky, and everyone either leaves the party, switches back to what they were drinking before, or starts doing drugs. Following this analogy, the revival of a genre could be the morning after, when you wake up and open the fridge, and see the fancy and re-refrigerated leftovers from the party and realize that they are actually better than what you usually have in the fridge and you start to (pick the interesting ones) consume them in a strange combinations and throw the bad ones out.


Opening
-------
So let's start (at a less controversial claim, and more easily verifiable claim...) at the beginning and see how genres are born.
Breakthrough singles > They propel genre from a proto phase (in which it is slowly maturing/developing/brewing/fermenting) to a golden age.

Staleness
---------
It just stands there, none is ready to take it into the kitchen, yet almost none wants to drink it anymore


Morning After
-------------
We can actually enjoy the champagne with clearer view and enjoy it for its taste... and find the right combination of accompanying snacks, from the array of leftovers, ..

Of course after that it / or when the next thing comes we look at the mess and see basically garbage, that needs to be taken out. What were left with is only knowledge of how different brands really taste, so we can buy them in a future for different settings and combinations.

Realization that, that is something you almost never have at home, and it would probably make sense to give it another try. Of course this time in a way and with combination of foods, that really suits you, and not as on party, ones that were available to everyone at the moment.


Balloon Bursting (Genre killing albums and artists)
---------------------------------------------------
So what constitutes the death of a genre?

* Beck/Tom: Tipping point of where a genre can be stretched (so that definition still has some kind of coherency), and before the bubble bursts (the wave breaks), and we're left with broken fragments, up for grabs for everyone...

* Butterfly: Poetry...., Basically the whole album gives you a feeling like you are watching some messed up sf/thriller/horror/comedy/psycho drama/fantasy by Lynch.

Beck: Ending relationship/depression, Scientology
LCD: Being burdened by touring and thoughts of quiting and how to end it all, documentary/Madison square garden (commercialism?)
Lamar: More burdened by religion/family
Waits: What was he doing from 88 to 92?

So it's not like it's directly their fault, but more that they disheartened not only themselves, by creating the artworks that were bigger than themselves, but they (probably) disheartened also other artists, giving them something to aspire to, but with no clear direction forward (tipping point?)

Also it has to be mentioned that all this legendary works were a collaboration of many brilliant minds that enabled to bring out the best from the artists...

In Tom Waits case, first there was his wife that was (probably) a major influence on him to abandon his old "crying in the beer" persona and started a more cosmopolitan/gypsy and weird (sinister) character. (Also his encouraging split [but also producers ability to let waits experiment with different approaches] with his former producer with whom he recorded his first ? albums probably helped) Of course here were then the extraordinary musicians well versed in experimentation...

As for Beck there was an unbelievable "click" with dust brothers, legendary duo of producers and sampling gurus, who are responsible for Beastie boys boutique, and who's intentionally added crackling noises are probably their most recognizable contribution to hip hop. (signature sound)

As for LCD Soundsystem it is pretty clear that he would have a great difficulty realizing his ideas on Sound of silver... Ideas feel so organic/lively and jammy, that it feels it would be impossible to realize them to such "standing/solidity" without a band (with only season musicians).

And of course Lamar's Butterfly, what more could be said... The amount of exceptional musicians and producers that had to work their asses of to make a record so perfectly produced, but that on no moment sound overproduced...





===================
===================
===================

* punk > 06 (joy division)
* rnr > ramones
* Waits > Ali niso komadi, kot naprimer 1.Lie to me iz brawlers bol al man skoraj enaki komadom iz bi time ere?
* RNB/ROCKABILY: Not counterpart but rockabilly played by bl. musicians, or maybe: The same music as rockabilly, but played by bl. musicians.
* Describe how this are high genres, that incorporate many small ones (ska, dub/ Metal > rock,...)
* EDM -> Sitting down (can maintain our focus)

-----------------

Pizda, pred elvisom je vse ful fluid, blues, boogie, country, rockabilly, skor nemogoce lepo razdelit vse...
Mogoce lahk to pripisem dejstvu da so singlce dominirale, kar je omogocl velik hitrejso absorbcijo novih elementov iz sorodnih zanrov...

---

Pa segregirani radiji so mel dost zraven, tko da so bli skor vsi stili podvojeni (al pa potrojeni, ce upostevamo se big bande ki so tud absorbiral vse novosti)...
Elvisov singl alright mama (54) je bil ful pomemben, ker ga niso hotl country radiji vrtet ker je biu too black, crni pa ker je bil too country, pol je pa ful eksplodiru in pripomogu da se je ta segregacija nehala.

Anyways, u glavnem mislm da mam resitev, in sicer bom dal vso to "navlako" pod proto rnr in je stvar resena :)

---

Exactly, vsi so bol al mn vse spilal,
sam ta model je meu pac par country komadov vmes (pa klobuk, aja pa biu je beuc), da je lahko pol spilov po teh kantri tv showih, ko so bli takrat ful popularni.

---

Mislm ja, v osnovi je to boogie woogie, ki se mu je pocasi dodajal instrumente in vokale (na zacetku se je spilov samo na klavirju in bol al mn brez vokalov, izvira pa iz severnega teksasa) in na koncu se je temu rekl rock and roll, ampak ni pa nobenega ful revolucionarnega preloma v tem razvoju.

---

Razen komada rock around a clock, ki je zacel rock and roll craze (ker je bil v enmu filmu), ampak to bi biu lahko tud ker drug komad...

=====

Ma ja, doklr je zanr v proto fazi se ful organsko razvija, z majhnimi koraki, pol pa ko se enkrat prebije in pride v primez industrije/dobi label (zacne prnasat denar), se pa stvari dost spremenijo. 

=====

Sam to se ni mel tolk mocnega vpliva pred rockenrolom, ker si meu tri locene trge (crni, country pa bigband), tko da ko je ena industrija prjela en svoj zanr (naprimer crna bluz v 25 - 35) sta ga lahko ostale dve neobremenjeno absorbirali in evolvali na svoj nacin.

---

Me je zanimal še če so mel črnci tud svoje "record companies" (poleg štacun in radijov) in skor ja (sam da so belci na koncu pobral denar :)

Most of Paramount's race music recordings were arranged by black entrepreneur J. Mayo Williams. "Ink" Williams, as he was known, had no official position with Paramount, but he was given wide latitude to bring African-American talent to the Paramount recording studios and to market Paramount records to African-American consumers. Williams did not know at the time that the "race market" had become Paramount's prime business and that he was keeping the label afloat.

---

Dobr, sej na koncu je pa odpru svoj Sazas, ki je sam pobirov denar od pravic, ki jih je nabrou skozi leta, se bol fancy... 
Pa itak, ce se je le dal ni naprej artistiom posredvov njihov share... klasika :)

---

Pa tud dost ocitno je iz podatka, da je prtisku na artiste da naj "clean upajo svoj act", da je hotu s crno musko prodret tud na beli trg. To je mogu bit takrat ful holy grail, kao komu bo prvemu ratal (sanse za obratno, se prav da bi crnci zacel poslusat country, so ble verjetn manjse :).

Mislm da je biu prvi artist, ki mu je zares ratal Louis Jordan  (jump blues/rnb, rnr v bistvu) leta 46, z hiti ala Caldonia, ko so beli tinejdzeri ful zapalil... Naprimer v eni crni stacuni v crnem delu LA-ja, so takrat zabelezl da so 40% plat prodal belcem, kar je blo verjeten pred tem skor nula.

---

Iz te perspektive ma tud tist Hitler blues dost smisla, koncno so bli crnci in belci v istem dreku 》record blues song 》profit :)
