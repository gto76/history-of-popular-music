Did Lamar just kill Hip Hop?
============================

Ok, hold your horses. Just let me explain the theory and then judge.


Life Expectancy of a Genre
--------------------------
So according to my theory, every major popular music genre has roughly 30 years until it's done. Done in a sense that after that nothing can change our perception of what a genre is and what it should sound like.

Three Periods in Life of a Genre
--------------------------------
As shown on the graph, every genre starts with a proto era (green area), in which it is slowly and gradually developing. Then comes the breakthrough single, which (starts the craze/puts it in a spotlight) puts it on a map and draws the attention of listeners, artists and music business alike. This is the start of the genre's golden age which lasts roughly 10 years, and also a moment in which the clock starts ticking. Then follows 10 years of crisis in which two other genres steel the focus. In second half of the crisis era, there emerges one sub-genre, that brings out the worst of the genre, examples of which are glam rock, hair metal, skate punk, bling rap and brostep. Crisis ends with a revival of a genre that usually consists of many new and diverse sub-genres. And now comes my [controversial?] claim, that the death of a genre happens between two albums made by an exceptional artist. One a masterpiece, that the artist is never again able to surpass, although he produces many more great albums, and the other the album after that. The masterpiece album rises expectations and appetites of many and the future of the genre seems bright, while actually it stands on it's last legs (it's on it's last breath).

Chosen Prominent Artists
------------------------
Another thing that might be controversial in this theory besides the selection of the "chosen ones" are the genres they are associated with. But anyways, lets list them, namely Tom Waits for Rock and roll, Beck for Rock, LCD Soundsystem for Punk and Lamar for Hip-hop. Lamar is probably the least controversial choice among them, simply because he's a rapper, but still if we look at the music on the Pimp a Butterfly, it's a mix of many diverse genres and sounds, everything from funk to jazz and that's something that is common to all the chosen legendary albums. Specifically Tom Waits' Big time, a collection of live recordings of songs from his last three albums, could be described as anything from blues, gospel, ballads, blues rock and cabaret... Becks' Odelay could be described as a mixture of old-school hip-hop, delta blues, country, grunge and noise. LCD Soundsystems' Sound of Silver contains mixture of electronica, funk, new wave, post-punk and Bowie's sound.


Selection of Genres
-------------------
So maybe let's first focus on less controversial choices â€” the selection of the genres and why they are divided as they are. Maybe the most glaring are the omissions of Pop and Jazz, but also if you look closely the EDM (electronic dance music) does not start before 1990. That is because I excluded the EDM, that is made for dancefloor and only left the part that can be listened sitting down. Pop is, as it was mentioned many times before, the ultimate absorber and survivor and it will exist forever. Jazz is a genre that really comes to life in live setting and trough improvisation, and something always gets lost when it's captured on a record.


Proto Rock and Roll Sub-genres
------------------------------
Another curiosity is quantity of genres crammed in to rock and roll, before it's breakthrough single "Rock Around the Clock" that started the rock and roll craze in 1956. Reason for that is that the progress from boogie-woogie to fully developed rock and roll was exceptionally gradual. This evolution basically consists of addition of new instruments and vocals to the rhythm that stayed pretty much the same from the beginning. Of course there were the sub-genres, that had their own rhythms, and are not meant to be included in proto R'n'R, such as western music (that is a part of country).

Main reasons for the big break that happened in 56 is the merging of black and country markets (and also singles/albums). Before that almost no white people were buying black music and vice versa. This, together with a shorter time that was needed from recording session to release of a single, contributed to more fluid progression of a style, that became known as rock and roll.

Selection of Genre Defining Singles
-----------------------------------
So as with rock and roll, every major genre that succeeded it, started with a hit single, that basically defined it, and so it happens that this singles were following each other in intervals of roughly 10 years. The other singles being "Satisfaction" by Rolling stones for rock, "Blietzkrieg Bop" by Ramones for punk, "Walk this way" by RUN DMC for Hip-hop and "Firestarter" by Prodigy for EDM (electronic dance music).

For rock other candidates could be earlier single "You Really Got Me" by Kinks if one would want to include the whole British garage rock scene under rock or maybe some later single that was not anymore in style of garage rock like "Light My Fire" by the Doors. God save the queen as a breaktrhrough single of a punk genre is hard to dispute, although Ramones' "Blitzkrieg Bop", from a year earlier, had much greater influence on other artists. As for hip-hop I think "Walk This Way" is a good fit, although it could be argued, that it was still in old-school style of hip-hop, and some other artists from next two years, like N.W.A. or Public Enemy better signify the hip-hops step into golden age. Nonetheless, none of them had such a big hit as RUN DMC had. For EDM, if we define it as an electronic dance music that can be listened to sitting down, the commercial success of Prodigy's album "Fat Of The land" must be the big breakthrough moment.


Proto Hip-hop Sub-genres
------------------------
Now I should probably address the oddity of exceptionally long era of proto hip hop. I must admit that it wasn't in my model from beginning in which the proto phase of hip-hop started with "Rapers delight" by Shugarhill gang. In this early version funk, disco and reggae were placed in revival phase of R'n'B. Problem with this approach is that R'n'B was pretty much always just an umbrella term for black music styles, that didn't exist before 1945. Also original R'n'B that was being played from 1945 to 1955 was together with rockabilly basically what became know as rock and roll after its breakthrough in 1955 and it has stylistically little in common with later "R'n'B". Another solution could also be to create a separate timeline for each one of these styles, but none of them had enough longevity and prominence to justify that also, and that's basically the reason that they got packaged inside the proto hip-hop era.


Is it too Good to be True
-------------------------
So how come this eras coincide so neatly? I must admit I didn't bother with it too much, but it must have something to do with the music industry / economic side of music. One theory could be based on the fact that the biggest force in sales of the albums were, at least from the mid 40's onward, the teenagers, which are at around the age of 14/15 most susceptible to the new music trends. And this new trends, must by definition sound and feel fresh and hip, they must be something your parents dislike and just don't get. So by this logic, if a genre is at the point or resurgence, this 15 year old teenager was 5 when it came into crisis, so just young enough to not yet be susceptible to the popular music.


No New Genre in 2006
--------------------
So only inconsistency on the timeline left is a lack of emergence of a new major genre around year 2006. There are two possible explanations. First one is that we can adequately classify popular music only in retrospective, and so are lacking the perspective, that will allow us to fully understand what is currently happening in music. But this explanation just feels insufficient if we take in consideration what a huge stirs rock and roll and rock created in their first years, how distinctive punk was from the rock of its era, and the hard separation of Hip-hop from other genres by simple fact that the lyrics are being raped. In this case probably the more pessimistic option is true, namely that there are no new major genres because the music industry as we knew it  was already in such a bad shape by the 2006, that it wasn't able to procreate and push out the next big thing.


Conclusion
----------
As for conclusion, I must say, that I find it hard to believe that hip hop has died in 2017. Maybe hip-hop as we know it died, but a new kind of hip-hop, musically much more daring and vibrant has just been born, and Lamar's single Be humble might just be the big break of this new kind of hip-hop, that was slowly fermenting during last 10 years.
